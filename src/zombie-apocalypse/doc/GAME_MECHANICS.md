## 🔢 PROBLEM TYPES

### **Level 1: Percent ↔ Decimal**
- Example: "Convert 4% to a decimal" → 0.04
- Includes tricky ones: 0.5 → 50%, 125% → 1.25

### **Level 2: Increase/Decrease**
- Example: "Sales tax 8%. Does total increase or decrease?" → increase
- Multiple choice: increase / decrease

### **Level 3: Calculate Amounts**
- Example: "Weapon costs $240. Tax is 7%. How much is the TAX?" → $16.80
- **Important:** Asks for the AMOUNT, not total

### **Level 4: Final Costs**
- Example: "Food costs $85. Tax is 6%. What's your TOTAL COST?" → $90.10
- **Important:** Asks for TOTAL/FINAL price

### **Level 5: Two-Step**
- Example: "Item $450, marked down 30%, then 8% tax. FINAL COST?" → $339.12
- Order matters! Discount THEN tax

### **Level 6: Backwards**
- Example: "After 35% off, costs $390. ORIGINAL price?" → $600
- Work backwards from the answer

### **Level 7: The Final Calculation**
- Multi-step epic problem
- Population changes + money + interest + division
- Requires all skills learned

## 💡 COMMON STUDENT MISTAKES TO WATCH FOR

1. **Percent to Decimal:**
   - 4% → 0.4 ❌ (should be 0.04 ✓)
   - 0.5 → 5% ❌ (should be 50% ✓)

2. **Question Reading:**
   - Mixing up "discount amount" vs. "sale price"
   - Confusing "tax amount" vs. "total cost"
   - Missing "ORIGINAL price" in backwards problems

3. **Two-Step Order:**
   - Doing tax THEN discount (wrong order)
   - Forgetting to calculate tax on SALE price

4. **Rounding:**
   - $45.7 instead of $45.70
   - Not rounding at all

5. **Calculator Dependency:**
   - Forgetting to convert percent to decimal
   - Losing intermediate values (use notepad!)

## 🎓 TEACHING TIPS

1. **Pre-Game:**
   - Review percent-decimal conversion
   - Discuss when to ADD vs. SUBTRACT
   - Emphasize reading the question carefully

2. **During Game:**
   - Encourage notepad use for multi-step
   - Remind them: one wrong answer is OK!
   - Watch for time pressure in Level 1

3. **Post-Game:**
   - Celebrate victories!
   - Review common mistakes from deaths
   - Use as formative assessment for re-teaching

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**"I got it right but it says wrong!"**
→ Check answer format (decimals, $ sign, etc.)

**"Calculator won't work!"**
→ Make sure it's not being dragged; click buttons clearly

**"I can't see my notepad!"**
→ It might be off-screen; drag it back

**"Level 1 is too hard!"**
→ 2 minutes for 7 problems = ~17 seconds each (should be plenty)

**"I died and went back too far!"**
→ Death drops ONE level (e.g., Level 5 → Level 4)
